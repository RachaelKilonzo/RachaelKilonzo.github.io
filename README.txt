The template being used to create this portfolio is Phantom by HTML5 UP html5up.net by  aj@lkn.io

It's a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some SVG and animation techniques.

I'm new to html so I am using the template to create my data science portfolio
